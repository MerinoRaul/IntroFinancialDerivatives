# IntroFinancialDerivatives
This are the supporing materials for the book "Introduction to Financial Derivatives with Python". This book is primarily addressed to undergraduate students in Economics
and related areas. No prior programming knowledge or advanced mathematics is required.

The notebooks do not claim to be industrial or efficient, nor follow a standard like PEP8. The purpose is to support theory and broaden the readerâ€™s perspective because 
mathematical finance is not just about theoretical formulas, but also about putting them into practice. At best, it will motivate the reader to learn more about coding.
